# Ptolemaic Projections

Just a small sparetime project to implement digital versions of [Ptolemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy)'s
map projections.

## Groovy

I originally started to play with a Groovy version of this in May 2011.

## JavaScript

I'm starting to port this code to more useful environments now. Potentially, I'd like to
have a custom projection for [D3](http://d3js.org/) and for [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org/)
and/or [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/).
